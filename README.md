# ZillowParse
Test task on web scraping and data processing

This is a test task that I received and completed:

1. It was necessary to parse 2 store sites and get all their addresses (https://locations.traderjoes.com/, https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/)
2. Send a request to the zillow.com website via the API according to the criteria that are on the site when searching
3. Must be an input of X miles (distance from each house to shops)
4. Compare the distance from each house to each store. The distance must not exceed X miles)
5. Collect addresses of stores that fit. Save all data in json


In order not to parse store sites once again, I attach 2 processed files with store addresses and their coordinates (T_J_stores_coord.json, WFM_stores_coord.json)

If you have any comments on my work, I will be glad to hear feedback.
